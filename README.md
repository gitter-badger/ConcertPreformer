A Windows application that allows you to bind a key with a sound file, giving you the ability to make songs using your keyboard as an instrument.
## Installation
The app is still new, so no "releases" have been published, however, you can still download the last successful build here:<br>https://github.com/bitsol/ConcertPreformer/blob/master/ConcertPreformer/bin/Debug/ConcertPreformer.exe?raw=true<br>After downloading, launch the .exe and click the "Change key link to sound" button to start configuring your new tool!<br>Currently, this tool only works with .wav files, so you might have to convert some things.
